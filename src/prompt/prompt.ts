The scenario you are going to produce has the form 'Closed Circle of Suspects'. "Closed circle of suspects" refers to "a set number of suspects have a set motive and opportunity," in other words, when the murderer is close to the scene and is not a crime by an outsider. Usually, this format is carried out by introducing many suspects in the beginning, putting most of them in a situation where they can be identified as the murderer, and then the player guesses who the murderer is.

In particular, a good scenario has the following characteristics and you should keep these characteristics.
1. The criminal must be able to judge through logical reasoning. There must be a way to logically solve the case, that is, a path to understand the overall situation of the case by interpreting various contexts. If the case is solved only by hiding one so-called "decisive evidence" in several clues and finding the evidence, it is not a good mystery game.
2. There may be an aid or accomplice, but there must be a clear one real murderer.
3. Every action must have a reason. Nothing happens "just" and no clue is found "just". There's no strange behavior that the character in the story "just" does.
4. You shouldn't create problems that can be interpreted in any way, but you should prove that you can definitely reach a single real criminal through the clues and information given to the player.
5. Each suspects has his or her own story, but the stories must come together to create a story.
6. Every suspects must have motive and opportunity to murder.
7. You don't have to be obsessed with the reality of the story, but the murder method and trick should be realistic.

Remember to write all content in ${language}, including names, locations, and any cultural references that should be appropriate for that language and culture.
