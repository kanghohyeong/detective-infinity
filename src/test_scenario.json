This toxin was later found on a jacket that she had worn on the night of the murder, which placed her at the scene of the crime. Additionally, a witness reported seeing Rachel sneaking out of the house around the time of the murder, which contradicted her alibi. These pieces of evidence were enough to prove that Rachel was the killer."
